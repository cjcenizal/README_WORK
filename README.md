# Hi! I'm CJ.

I made this to share a bit about myself with you so we can work together more effectively. I want you to know that I care about your success (and our success working together) -- if there's anything you think I can do to improve how I work with you, please let me know! Even if it's a difficult discussion, I promise I will do my best to listen and act on your feedback.

## Fun facts

I live near Los Angeles with my wife, daughter, and dog (Never Ever). I love to read, hike, camp, karaoke, watch movies, travel, garden, and cook. My favorite karaoke song is â€œIce Ice Baby" followed closely by â€œUnder the Bridge", my favorite drink is an Old Fashioned, and I once made a [video game](http://www.atomicarmies.com/)!

## Principles

Over time I've accumulated a set of principles which I've found to be useful and upon which I try to base my decisions.

* **Engineering is a team sport.** I value a great code review as much as a great PR. I like to think no one person owns any part of a codebase, but that we all own all of it. A teammate's happiness is as important as my own. :)
* **Bias for action.** I think analysis paralysis over an idea can be broken by just trying it out. If it's cheap to fix a mistake, then I think it's worth risking failure in order to learn something new.
* **Good leaders motivate.** I work well with leaders who collaborate instead of command. Likewise, I like to lead by framing problems, eliciting solutions, and sharing in decision-making. Consensus isn't always possible or necessary, but I think it's important that everyone's voice be heard.
* **Good decision-making is objective and transparent.** Outcome of the decision aside, I think everybody benefits when a decision is backed by objective reasoning and that reasoning is clearly articulated and freely shared.

## Working with me

I'm an extrovert in small groups and an introvert in large ones. I'll talk a lot if there are a few of us together, but in larger groups I'll spend most of my time listening and thinking so don't worry if I seem unusually quiet. I don't travel well, so if we're on a retreat I'm usually at about 70% of my normal brain function. I'm also well-adapted to remote work so a long day of interacting with people at a retreat really drains me and I will usually try to find some quiet time to recharge. I love it when presentation slides or meeting agendas are shared before the actual meeting so that I can form some thoughts and questions ahead of time. I also love it when someone sends out an email after a meeting with a recap of the most salient points. Sometimes I will do this but if I'm not the meeting owner I'll usually just cross my fingers that someone else will do it. If you're having a bad day or need to vent to someone, I'm a great listener and won't judge you.

## Flaws

I've got my own share of flaws, so here is a list of things I'm working on improving about myself. This list is by no means comprehensive!

* **Asking questions.** Communication is as much about interpretation as it is about articulation and I've found that many disagreements I have with people are due to misunderstanding. I'm trying to get better at asking questions to gain a clear understanding of other people's positions before forming responses to them.
* **Defaulting to yes.** People have pointed out to me that I can be pretty stubborn, and I think my wife mentions this to me at least twice a week. One way I'd like to improve this is by defaulting to agreement with a person's suggestion, to circumvent any internal biases I may have on the topic when we discuss it.
